4.Question 4
Let u and v be 3-dimensional vectors, where specifically

u=⎡⎣−343⎤⎦
and

v=⎡⎣315⎤⎦
What is u^Tvu 
T
 v?

(Hint: u^Tu 
T
  is a

1x3 dimensional matrix, and v can also be seen as a 3x1

matrix. The answer you want can be obtained by taking

the matrix product of u^Tu 
T
  and vv.) Do not add brackets to your answer.

5.Question 5
Let A and B be 3x3 (square) matrices. Which of the following

must necessarily hold true? Check all that apply.


A * B = B * AA∗B=B∗A


If B is the 3x3 identity matrix, then A * B = B * A A∗B=B∗A

Correct
                        Even though matrix multiplication is not commutative in general (A*B \neq B*AA∗B≠B∗A for general matrices A, BA,B), for the special case where B=IB=I, we have A*B = A*I = AA∗B=A∗I=A, and also B*A = I*A = AB∗A=I∗A=A. So, A*B = B*AA∗B=B∗A.


If C = A*BC=A∗B, then C is a 3x3 matrix.

Correct
                        Since A and B are both 3x3 matrices, their product is 3x3.  More generally, if A were an m \times nm×n. matrix, and B a n\times on×o matrix, then C would be m\times om×o.  (In our example, m=n=o=3m=n=o=3.)


A*B*A = B*A*B A∗B∗A=B∗A∗B
